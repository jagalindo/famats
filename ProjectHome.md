FaMa Tool Suite (FaMaTS) is a tool for the automated analysis of variability models (VM). Its main objective is providing an extensible framework where current research on VM automated analysis might be developed and easily integrated into a final product.

FaMaTS is built following the SPL paradigm supporting different variability metamodels, reasoners or solvers, analysis questions and reasoner selectors, easing the production of customized VM analysis tools.

FaMaTS component-based architecture allows to extend or update FaMaTS by means of the so-called FaMa Extensions. We summarize the benefits of using FaMaTS:


  * Easy to integrate: FaMaTS has a simple and stable front-end Java interface(QuestionTrader), implementing a query-based interaction.

  * Easy to extend: FaMaTS architecture allows to extend or update existing products just by adding or updating its components or features. Third-parties are allowed to develop and integrated their own FaMa Extensions.

  * Easy to configure: FaMaTS is configured by means of an unique XML file, asing its maintenance and configuration to adapt the tool to the user needs.
